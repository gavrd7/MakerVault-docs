# Your workshop, organised.

Learn to install MakerVault, record what you own and bring your projects, files and 3D printing together. Start with one project. Add the rest when you need it.

!!! info "Current release: v0.9.0.2 · Before v1"
    The guide overview and integration status were reconciled with the merged v0.9.0.2 implementation on 2 October 2026. K1/K2 monitoring and camera playback have owner confirmation. Clean-install, recovery, upgrade and broader hardware acceptance remain separate v1 work. See [scope and verification](reference/about.md).

### Set up your own server
No previous Docker experience assumed. Understand the few terms you need, install the application and create your first account.

### Use it every day
Find a board, add the units you own, plan a build and keep its files together.

### Organise 3D printing
Keep track of printers, camera feeds, physical spools, models, print history and explicitly retained printed parts.

## Learn by doing

The quickest way to understand how MakerVault's records relate to one another is the [guided newcomer workflow](getting-started/first-project.md). It walks through one small project from catalogue lookup and physical inventory to a BOM, files, optional wiring, a printable model, a retained printed part and a Maker Tag.

You can stop after the core project/BOM/file steps if you do not use 3D printing or tags.

## What MakerVault does

MakerVault is a self-hosted workshop management application. You open it in a web browser; your own server stores the data. You can use it without a printer integration or cloud account.

| What you want to record | Where it belongs | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| What a product is | Catalogue | An ESP32 development board and its specifications |
| What you actually own | Inventory | Three boards in drawer A2 |
| What you are building | Projects | A voice-assistant speaker and its bill of materials |
| Digital assets | Files | Firmware, wiring diagram, CAD and instructions |
| What you design and print | 3D Printing | Enclosure revisions, spools, live cameras and retained parts |
| Physical identification | Maker Tags | A QR/NFC/RFID identity linked to a spool or project |
| Connections in a build | Interactive Wiring | A diagram of boards, pins and wires |

Catalogue records are shared reference information. Personal workspaces are separated by account. A project is not currently a shared team folder. [Read about accounts](administration/accounts.md) before setting up a multi-user installation.

## Choose your route

- **New to self-hosting?** Read *Before you begin*, *Install MakerVault* and *First sign-in*, in that order.
- **Someone has already installed it for you?** Start with [First sign-in](getting-started/first-sign-in.md), then follow the [guided newcomer workflow](getting-started/first-project.md).
- **Already comfortable with Docker?** Use the installation settings table and [configuration reference](reference/configuration.md).
- **Want a domain name or single sign-on?** Finish the normal setup first, then visit [reverse proxies](advanced/reverse-proxy.md) and [OIDC](advanced/oidc.md).
