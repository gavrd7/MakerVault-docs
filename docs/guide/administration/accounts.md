# Accounts and storage

**For the installation administrator**

## Add a local user

1. Sign in as a superuser and open **Administration**.
2. Open **Users** and add a user with a unique username and strong initial password.
3. Save, then edit the user's permissions/groups.
4. Add **Editor** for everyday creation/editing, or **Viewer** for read-only access to records the account is allowed to see.
5. Keep **Active** enabled. Grant **Staff status** only if administrative access is needed, and **Superuser status** only for a full administrator.
6. Ask the person to sign in and change their initial password through **Account & Security**.

A group grants actions, not ownership of another person's workspace. The default Editor group includes view/add/change core permissions and inventory deletion; it does not grant every delete action. A button may be absent because a specific permission is missing.

Local self-registration is disabled by default. Enabling `ALLOW_LOCAL_REGISTRATION` is a separate administrative decision. OIDC provisioning is configured separately and does not mean a new identity should automatically become an administrator.

## What is shared?

Shared catalogue/reference records describe products. Personal inventory, projects, files, printers, spools, models, print history and integration settings are owner-scoped. Current project workspaces are not a general team-sharing system.

The normal administration summary exposes aggregate counts and storage, not a cross-user project/file browser. Nevertheless, the server operator controls the database, code, backups and storage key. Encryption at rest is not end-to-end encryption against that operator.

## Set quotas

As a superuser, open **Settings → Users & storage**. Review each account's status, aggregate record counts and usage.

- **Default policy:** Limited or Unlimited for users following the instance default.
- **Instance default:** the account follows the current default policy.
- **Custom limit:** a per-user quota in GiB.
- **Unlimited:** no application-level quota for that account.

Save the policy or the user's quota with its corresponding button. New installations default to unlimited storage in this edition. A quota is not reserved disk space: all users still share the host's physical capacity.

Usage includes retained files/versions and private images. Lowering a quota does not automatically delete existing files. If an upload is refused, inspect current usage, the requested file size and host free space. Consider exporting wanted versions before removing data.

## Disable, purge and delete

**Disable** blocks account use while preserving data and can be reversed. It is the usual first action when access should stop.

**Purge private data** removes that user's private workspace but preserves the account. **Delete account** removes the account and its private data. These require typing the exact username and have no ordinary undo. The UI blocks self-disable/self-purge/self-delete.

Confirm the user and make a restorable backup before either destructive operation. Shared catalogue information is not that user's private workspace to purge.
