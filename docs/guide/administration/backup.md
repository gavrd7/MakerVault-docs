# Back up and restore

**Goal:** recover your installation, including encrypted private files, after a disk or server failure.

!!! warning "The key is essential"
    A database backup alone is not a complete backup. Encrypted uploads require both their stored bytes and the matching key. Do not generate a replacement key to repair missing-key errors.

## What belongs in a recovery set

| Item | Why you need it |
| --- | --- |
| PostgreSQL dump | Accounts, projects, catalogue records, file references and other structured data |
| Media archive | Uploaded files and cached images |
| Key archive | The key that decrypts private uploads |
| TLS archive (v3+) | MakerVault-owned native HTTPS certificate/private key, when used |
| Recovery `.env` / deployment settings | Secrets, storage paths and supported deployment settings |
| Source revision | The matching version of MakerVault for the first restore |
| Redis data (optional for core records) | Queue/cache state; not a substitute for the database |

Keep the set together in a protected backup destination, with another copy on a different device. A folder on the same failing disk is not disaster recovery. Protect the entire set: it contains credentials, personal data and the key needed to read the uploads.

## Recommended: use MakerVault's Backup & restore page

For the standard Docker Compose installation, a superuser should normally use **Settings → Backup & restore**. You do not need to stop containers, run `pg_dump`, find Docker volumes or manually copy the encryption key.

### Create a backup

1. Open **Settings → Backup & restore**.
2. Select **Create backup**.
3. MakerVault briefly makes normal writes read-only while it captures a consistent recovery set. You can continue viewing the application.
4. Wait for the backup to finish. The page changes the start banner to **Backup complete** when the bundle has been created and verified; if you navigate elsewhere in MakerVault, a global notification reports completion or failure.
5. Confirm the backup shows **Verified**, then select **Download** and keep a copy on another device or protected backup destination.

MakerVault stores managed backups in `BACKUP_STORAGE`, which defaults to the `makervault_backups` Docker volume. You can use an absolute bind-mount path instead, for example:

```dotenv
BACKUP_STORAGE=/mnt/Server/MakerVault/backups
```

The Backup & restore page shows completed bundles, total stored size, validation state and creation time. Old backups are retained until an administrator deletes them; MakerVault does not silently remove recovery copies.

!!! warning "A .mvbackup file contains secrets"
    A managed `.mvbackup` bundle contains the PostgreSQL dump, media, private-storage key, deployment configuration and, for v3+ bundles, MakerVault-owned TLS identity. File permissions and authenticated MakerVault access protect the server-side copy, but the bundle itself is **not encrypted**. Store downloaded copies only on storage you trust.

### What happens behind the button

The web application does **not** receive access to the Docker socket. Managed backup creation runs through MakerVault's existing Celery worker inside the normal `makervault` container. That worker already has the application database connection and the media/key/TLS/backup mounts required to create a recovery bundle, so no fourth long-running service is needed.

MakerVault creates a maintenance lock before capturing data. Normal read-only viewing continues, while web/API writes are rejected briefly and MakerVault's scheduled catalogue, integration and printer-poll jobs defer until the lock clears. This prevents new application-side mutations from starting underneath the capture. The bundle is not marked complete until PostgreSQL's dump catalogue, the media/key/TLS archives and recorded SHA-256 checks have all been read successfully.

Redis queue/cache data is deliberately excluded from normal recovery. Core MakerVault records are in PostgreSQL.\n\nFor the standard deployment, MakerVault reconstructs the recovery `.env` from the supported settings listed in `.env.example` and the values currently supplied to the container. Custom Compose override files, shell-only variables that are not part of the supported environment template, and external secret files remain advanced deployment responsibility and should be preserved separately.

### Validate a backup again

On the Backup & restore page select **Validate / restore** beside a completed bundle. MakerVault re-reads its checksum manifest, PostgreSQL dump and media/key archives before showing the restore action.

Validation detects accidental corruption and malformed archives. It does not prove that an off-server copy can survive a total machine failure; periodically test recovery on a separate host.

## Restore a managed backup on the same server

A running web application cannot safely replace its own database and storage, and MakerVault deliberately does not expose host-level Docker control to the web process. After **Validate / restore**, the page therefore gives you one guarded command to run from the MakerVault checkout:

```bash
python3 scripts/restore.py --sudo --backup-id BACKUP_ID
```

Replace `BACKUP_ID` with the value shown by MakerVault.

For installations built directly from source using `compose.build.yaml`, add `--build-override` so the restore helper uses both Compose files:

```bash
python3 scripts/restore.py --sudo --build-override --backup-id BACKUP_ID
```

The helper recognises `compose.yaml`, `compose.yml`, `docker-compose.yaml`, and `docker-compose.yml` as the primary Compose file. If more than one exists, it reports which one it selected. The `--build-override` option is only needed when using the local source-build override. The UI's Copy command button displays confirmation on successful copy and offers a manual selection fallback when clipboard access is blocked.

 The helper:

1. confirms that no backup is still running;
2. validates the selected bundle again;
3. asks you to type the backup ID;
4. stops MakerVault;
5. creates a fresh **pre-restore safety backup** of the current installation;
6. restores PostgreSQL, media, the encryption key and the v3+ TLS identity together; and
7. rebuilds/starts MakerVault.

If the safety backup fails, the destructive restore is not started. If restoring fails after data replacement has begun, MakerVault is left stopped and the helper prints the safety-backup recovery command rather than starting against a partial restore.

Afterwards, sign in and check a known project, inventory item and private file before deleting either the original or the automatic pre-restore backup.

## Recover after total server loss

Keep at least one downloaded `.mvbackup` away from the MakerVault server. On a replacement Linux host:

1. Install Docker Engine, Docker Compose and Git.
2. Clone the MakerVault repository. Prefer the release recorded in the backup; the bundle records the MakerVault version that created it.
3. **Do not create a replacement `.env` if the original server is gone.** The restore helper can recover the saved one from a verified bundle. On a clean off-server restore it also detects the replacement host's routable IPv4 address and appends that address to `DJANGO_ALLOWED_HOSTS` and the applicable direct HTTP/HTTPS origins to `DJANGO_CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS`, preserving all restored values.
4. Copy the `.mvbackup` file to the new host.
5. From the MakerVault checkout run:

```bash
python3 scripts/restore.py --sudo --bundle /path/to/your-backup.mvbackup
```

Before it trusts any configuration from the file, the helper checks the bundle structure and every recorded inner SHA-256 value. If the checkout has no `.env`, it restores the verified saved configuration with owner-only permissions, prepares PostgreSQL/Redis and the MakerVault image, imports the bundle, validates it again through the recovery tooling, restores database/media/key storage plus the v3+ TLS identity stored under key storage and starts MakerVault. If MakerVault-managed self-signed HTTPS is enabled, the replacement host receives a fresh self-signed certificate for its recovered address rather than reusing a certificate whose SANs belong to the old host.

If automatic address detection is unsuitable (for example, a multi-homed host), pass the intended direct-access IPv4 address explicitly with `--recovery-host ADDRESS`; the option may be repeated. Reverse-proxy hostnames and HTTPS origins are not guessed and still require deliberate configuration review.

If a `.env` already exists, the helper **does not overwrite it silently**. This is intentional: deployment-specific hostnames, storage paths or credentials may need human review. For a genuine full-machine replacement, starting from a clean checkout avoids accidentally mixing a new installation's secrets with the recovery set.

Bind-mount paths saved in the old `.env` may not exist on the replacement host. Create or adjust those paths deliberately before the final start if the new server layout differs.

## Legacy one-command host backup

The earlier host-side helper remains available for troubleshooting and specialised deployments:

```bash
python3 scripts/backup.py --sudo
```

It creates a protected `.tar.gz` recovery set outside the managed Backup & restore page and briefly stops the application. It remains useful when the managed in-app backup path cannot run, but it is no longer the normal administrator workflow.

By default it saves under `~/makervault-backups/`; choose another destination with `--destination`. Its bundle is also not encrypted. Keep it private and off-server.

## Advanced manual backup

The following Linux procedure works with the standard Compose mounts, including named volumes or bind mounts. It stops the app briefly so uploads and database records cannot change independently while being copied. Run it from the source folder, in the same terminal. Make sure enough free space is available first.

Create a unique destination and build/reuse the application's image:

```bash
bash
umask 077
backup_dir="$HOME/makervault-backups/$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S)"
mkdir -p "$backup_dir"
git rev-parse HEAD > "$backup_dir/source-commit.txt"
cp .env compose.yaml "$backup_dir/"
sudo docker compose build makervault
sudo docker compose stop makervault
```

Also preserve any Compose override files, external secret files and intentional shell-provided configuration. `cp .env compose.yaml` covers only the standard setup. Do not publish this recovery set or attach it to an issue.

The database remains running for its logical dump. Stop if any step below fails; do not treat an incomplete set as a valid backup.

```bash
sudo docker compose exec -T postgres sh -c 'pg_dump -U "$POSTGRES_USER" -d "$POSTGRES_DB" -Fc' > "$backup_dir/database.dump"
sudo docker compose run --rm -T --no-deps --entrypoint tar makervault -C /app/media -czf - . > "$backup_dir/media.tar.gz"
sudo docker compose run --rm -T --no-deps --entrypoint tar makervault -C /app/keys --exclude=./tls -czf - . > "$backup_dir/keys.tar.gz"
sudo docker compose run --rm -T --no-deps --entrypoint tar makervault -C /app/keys/tls -czf - . > "$backup_dir/tls.tar.gz"
```

These one-off commands mount the normal storage but bypass the application's normal startup; they do not start another web server or migrate the database. If you use an external `MAKERVAULT_STORAGE_KEY` or a custom key-file location, back up that actual key source as well: the default `/app/keys` archive may not contain it.

Optionally capture Redis with it stopped:

```bash
sudo docker compose stop redis
sudo docker compose run --rm -T --no-deps --entrypoint tar redis -C /data -czf - . > "$backup_dir/redis.tar.gz"
sudo docker compose start redis
```

Check the main backup files:

```bash
test -s "$backup_dir/database.dump"
tar -tzf "$backup_dir/media.tar.gz" > /dev/null
tar -tzf "$backup_dir/keys.tar.gz" > /dev/null
tar -tzf "$backup_dir/tls.tar.gz" > /dev/null
sudo docker compose exec -T postgres pg_restore --list < "$backup_dir/database.dump" > "$backup_dir/database-contents.txt"
sudo docker compose start makervault
sudo docker compose ps
```

If a dump or archive step fails, restart any services you stopped with `sudo docker compose start redis makervault`, investigate, and create a new recovery set. Never label the failed set complete.

After every backup file is final, record checksums:

```bash
(cd "$backup_dir" && sha256sum database.dump media.tar.gz keys.tar.gz tls.tar.gz .env compose.yaml source-commit.txt > SHA256SUMS)
```

Include additional configuration/key files and optional Redis archives in your checksum list too. Checksums detect accidental corruption, not malicious replacement of both files and manifest.

Check the application works again. Copy the protected recovery set off the server. These checks detect some broken archives; only a successful test restore proves the whole set is usable.

Run `exit` when the manual backup is complete to leave the restricted shell.

Do not copy a running PostgreSQL data directory as a substitute for `pg_dump` unless you are deliberately using a PostgreSQL-aware physical backup method.

## Restore to a clean test server

Use a separate host or VM with no existing MakerVault deployment. The Compose project uses fixed container names; changing only the port does not isolate a second installation on the same Docker host. The following procedure is for **empty target storage**, not a repair over a live installation.

1. Install Docker/Compose and clone the repository as in the installation chapter.
2. Read `source-commit.txt` and check out that exact revision with `git checkout COMMIT_FROM_BACKUP`, substituting its value.
3. Copy the saved `.env` into the source directory. Adjust bind paths, hostnames/origins and port for the test server. Keep the database credentials, Django secret and matching storage key. Use empty target storage paths/volumes.
4. Keep the target isolated from printers, Spoolman and cloud integrations during the test. Restored schedules can run as soon as the app starts.
5. In that same terminal set `backup_dir` to the restored backup folder's absolute path.

Before starting services or extracting anything, verify the transferred recovery set:

```bash
(cd "$backup_dir" && sha256sum --check SHA256SUMS)
```

Stop on a missing file or mismatch. Older sets without a manifest need careful review and a test restore; do not create a manifest after transfer and treat it as evidence that transfer was correct. Extract only your own trusted backups.

Build the matching image and start only the backing services:

```bash
sudo docker compose build makervault
sudo docker compose up -d postgres redis
sudo docker compose ps
```

Wait for PostgreSQL to become healthy. Restore its records into the empty database, then media and keys:

```bash
sudo docker compose exec -T postgres sh -c 'pg_restore --exit-on-error --no-owner --no-privileges -U "$POSTGRES_USER" -d "$POSTGRES_DB"' < "$backup_dir/database.dump"
sudo docker compose run --rm -T --no-deps --entrypoint tar makervault -C /app/media -xzf - < "$backup_dir/media.tar.gz"
sudo docker compose run --rm -T --no-deps --entrypoint tar makervault -C /app/keys -xzf - < "$backup_dir/keys.tar.gz"
sudo docker compose run --rm -T --no-deps --entrypoint tar makervault -C /app/keys/tls -xzf - < "$backup_dir/tls.tar.gz"
```

Stop on any error. Do not use these extraction commands to mix a backup with existing live files. The default startup repairs application storage ownership; deployments with `FIX_PERMISSIONS=false` must arrange correct ownership themselves.

For the normal recovery test, a fresh Redis queue avoids replaying old queued work. If preserving Redis is intentional, stop Redis and restore its archive to empty `/data` through a one-off container before restarting it.

Start MakerVault only after database, media, the correct private-storage key and any native-TLS identity are restored:

```bash
sudo docker compose up -d makervault
sudo docker compose logs --tail=100 makervault
```

## Verify the recovery

Sign in; open a known project; inspect inventory; download a private file and an older version; open a model; check storage and account settings. Disable unwanted schedules before permitting external network access. Keep the original backup unchanged until these checks pass.

Once restoration works at the backed-up revision, follow the ordinary [update procedure](updates.md). Returning only the application code to an older version does not reverse database migrations.

## Authenticate restored private files

On versions that include the recovery audit, run it after restoring the database, media and key, before starting the normal app/worker:

```bash
sudo docker compose run --rm -T --no-deps --entrypoint python makervault manage.py verify_private_storage
sudo docker compose run --rm -T --no-deps --entrypoint python makervault manage.py audit_private_ownership --fail-on-issues
```

The private-file audit is read-only. It reads every referenced private file, authenticates encrypted content and compares recorded SHA-256 values where available. It fails for missing files, missing/invalid/wrong keys, damaged encrypted blobs or checksum mismatches. It reports legacy plaintext separately. It does not create a key, repair files, check unreferenced media or prove all application relationships are correct. Large libraries require time and temporary disk space for decrypted reads; do not run it as a frequent health probe.

After normal startup has restored storage ownership, repeat the file audit as the application's user to check permissions too:

```bash
sudo docker compose exec -T --user makervault makervault python manage.py verify_private_storage
```

If the backed-up release predates this command, perform its manual recovery checks first; do not substitute newer application code into the initial restore solely to obtain the command.

## Automated recovery rehearsal

The repository's Docker CI runs `scripts/recovery_rehearsal.sh` against the built application image. It creates synthetic users, a project, inventory and two encrypted model/file revisions, then invokes the same one-command backup helper used by administrators. It verifies the bundle checksums and confirms the source app container was restarted before restoring its PostgreSQL/media/key contents. It restores into fresh target storage twice: once with named volumes and once with bind mounts.

Acceptance checks cover password login, project/model/version relationships, old/current authenticated downloads, rejection of another owner's access and private-file authentication as the unprivileged app user. Negative checks require missing and wrong keys to fail and require the real startup script to refuse replacement-key generation over encrypted uploads.

The rehearsal uses uniquely named disposable containers, an internal Docker network, no published ports and no web/worker processes. It removes only its own resources. This is synthetic same-version recovery evidence, not a copy of your installation and not a full OIDC/MFA, reverse-proxy, browser, clean-install or historical-upgrade test.

For a development checkout with Docker available:

```bash
sudo docker build -t makervault-recovery .
sudo bash scripts/recovery_rehearsal.sh makervault-recovery
```

A release still needs a protected restore of a representative real backup on a separate host, including its deployment configuration and manual UI checks above. Keep that test isolated from integrations until schedules have been reviewed.
