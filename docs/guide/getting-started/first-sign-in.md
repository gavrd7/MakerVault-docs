# First sign-in

**Goal:** check your account and make the application ready for everyday use.

## First administrator on a new installation (v1.0.5)

When there is no administrator, opening MakerVault's normal web address automatically redirects to the first-run administrator setup wizard. A server-generated, single-use token is required so an unauthenticated visitor cannot claim the administrator account. The token expires after 30 minutes.

From the installation directory on the Docker host, run:

```bash
sudo docker compose exec -u makervault makervault python manage.py first_run_token
```

If the installation uses a custom Compose project name or additional Compose files, include the same `-p` and `-f` flags used when starting MakerVault. Never share or screenshot the token. Enter it in the setup page, then choose an administrator username, email and password, and enter the password a second time to confirm it. The **Show passwords** option can help verify both entries before submitting.

Leave `MAKERVAULT_ADMIN_PASSWORD` blank in `.env` if you want the wizard; setting it can create the administrator automatically at startup. Once an administrator exists, the wizard is disabled and MakerVault shows its normal sign-in page. If you make a mistake with the password, use [administrator password recovery](../administration/accounts.md#recover-an-administrator-password-from-the-server) rather than reinstalling or deleting any data.

## Sign in

Open the address supplied by your administrator. If you installed MakerVault yourself, use the administrator account created during the first-run wizard (or an existing administrator account).

If your administrator has enabled local self-registration, choose **Create account** / **Sign up**, enter a username, email address and password, then follow any email-verification instructions for the installation. If self-registration is disabled, the administrator must create or provision your account instead.

## Check the basics

1. Check the username, timezone and currency in the page header. The displayed currency is not an automatic currency-conversion service.
2. Open **Board Catalogue** and **Components**. Starter records should be present. Missing images do not mean installation failed: image discovery is a separate background task.
3. If you are an administrator, open **Settings → Library updates** and review the maintenance schedule. Save any changes.
4. Create a small example project using the next chapter before importing a large collection.

## Secure your account

For the v1.0.5 interface, open **Settings → User Account** to review password, email, two-factor authentication and Connected accounts. Existing v1.0.4 installations continue using **Account & Security**.

An authenticator app adds a second sign-in step. Security keys can provide another strong factor, and recovery codes give you a way back into the account if the normal second factor is unavailable. Store recovery codes somewhere safe before depending on MFA.

For a local account, use the password controls under **Settings → User Account** when you need to change your password. Older v1.0.4 installations use **Account & Security**. Passkey availability depends on a suitable secure browser origin, normally HTTPS.

## Missing buttons or empty pages?

A new account does not automatically gain editing rights. An administrator can assign an appropriate **Admin / Supervisor / User / Viewer** role. Viewer access is read-only, while other capabilities depend on the assigned role and resource permissions. Administration settings are restricted to authorised roles.

Private inventory, projects, files, printers and spools belong to their creator. Signing in with a second account normally gives you a separate workspace, even when the shared catalogues contain the same products.

## Things you can leave until later

You do not need Spoolman, SimplyPrint, a printer connection, OIDC or a reverse proxy to begin organising your own local workshop. Add integrations only when there is existing data or equipment you want to connect.
