# HTTPS and reverse proxies

## HTTPS certificate wizard

Superusers can open **Settings → HTTPS & certificates** to see the current browser host, native HTTPS status and certificate details.

The wizard presents three deployment paths:

- **Reverse proxy** — recommended for public/domain deployments. Your proxy manages its own publicly trusted ACME/Let's Encrypt certificate and forwards to MakerVault's ordinary HTTP port.
- **Public ACME / Let's Encrypt** — MakerVault explains the public challenge requirements. MakerVault deliberately does not give its web process host/Docker privileges to open public ports or manipulate DNS, so use the reverse proxy or another host-level ACME client when public validation is required.
- **MakerVault Local CA** — designed for private LAN addresses such as `192.168.x.x`. Enter the IP/DNS names, select **Generate local HTTPS certificate**, then download **MakerVault Local CA** and trust that public CA certificate on each client. The CA private key never has a GUI download route.

With `MAKERVAULT_HTTPS_ENABLED=auto` (the default), the native HTTPS process waits until a valid certificate appears in key storage. Generating a local certificate from Settings therefore brings the separate HTTPS listener online without disabling the normal HTTP/reverse-proxy listener.

### Trust the MakerVault Local CA on client devices

The Local CA download is a **public certificate**. Install it only on devices you control and that should trust this MakerVault instance. The Local CA private key remains inside MakerVault key storage and is never offered for download.

The HTTPS wizard now presents the local flow as four explicit steps: **Generate → Download Local CA → Trust it on this device → Open HTTPS**.

For iPhone and iPad:

1. Tap **Download MakerVault Local CA** in **Settings → HTTPS & certificates** and open the downloaded certificate/profile.
2. Install the downloaded profile when iOS/iPadOS prompts you. If needed, find it under **Settings → General → VPN & Device Management**.
3. Open **Settings → General → About → Certificate Trust Settings**.
4. Under **Enable Full Trust for Root Certificates**, enable **MakerVault Local CA** and confirm.
5. Reopen the browser and load MakerVault's HTTPS address again.

For Windows, install the downloaded CA into **Trusted Root Certification Authorities** for the intended user/computer. On macOS, add it to Keychain Access and mark it trusted. On Android, use the device's security/credentials settings to install it as a CA certificate; menu wording varies by vendor/version. On Debian/Ubuntu-family Linux systems, copy it to `/usr/local/share/ca-certificates/MakerVault-Local-CA.crt` and run `sudo update-ca-certificates`; browsers with their own certificate store may also require an import.

You do **not** need to install the downloadable server certificate on each client. Trusting the Local CA is what lets clients trust future MakerVault server certificates issued by that same CA.

**Advanced · Optional for local use**

A reverse proxy accepts requests at your domain, handles HTTPS and forwards them to MakerVault. A certificate makes the browser's connection encrypted. DNS maps the domain to the address serving it.

This example uses **Nginx running on the same host**, with an already-issued certificate for `maker.example.com`. Replace the domain and certificate paths with your own. Certificate issuance/renewal depends on your DNS and hosting environment; use [Nginx's HTTPS documentation](https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/configuring_https_servers.html) and your certificate provider's current instructions.

## 1. Restrict and configure MakerVault

```dotenv
MAKERVAULT_BIND_ADDRESS=127.0.0.1
MAKERVAULT_PORT=8765
DJANGO_ALLOWED_HOSTS=maker.example.com
DJANGO_CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS=https://maker.example.com
DJANGO_SECURE_COOKIES=true
TRUST_PROXY_HEADERS=true
TRUST_X_FORWARDED_HOST=false
ALLAUTH_TRUSTED_PROXY_COUNT=1
DJANGO_SECURE_SSL_REDIRECT=false
DJANGO_HSTS_SECONDS=0
```

Apply with `sudo docker compose up -d`. Loopback binding prevents direct LAN access to the app port in this same-host topology. Do not enable trusted proxy headers while leaving an untrusted alternate route to the application.

## 2. Configure Nginx

```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name maker.example.com;
    return 301 https://$host$request_uri;
}
server {
    listen 443 ssl;
    server_name maker.example.com;
    ssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/maker.example.com/fullchain.pem;
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/maker.example.com/privkey.pem;
    client_max_body_size 64m;
    location / {
        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8765;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $remote_addr;
        proxy_read_timeout 120s;
    }
}
```

This single-proxy example overwrites forwarded headers rather than trusting values supplied by the client. The 64 MiB request limit is an example proxy policy, not a claim that every 64 MiB file fits after multipart overhead or other app limits.

Validate your configuration with `sudo nginx -t`, then reload Nginx using your host's service manager. Ensure the certificate renewal process also reloads Nginx after renewal.

## 3. Verify before tightening redirects

Open the HTTPS domain. Check the valid certificate, login, a form save, image loading, file upload/download and Account & Security. If you use OIDC, update its exact callback URL to the HTTPS domain.

After HTTPS and forwarded scheme handling work, set `DJANGO_SECURE_SSL_REDIRECT=true` and recreate the app container. Start HSTS only after deciding the hostname will remain reliably HTTPS-only; a long-lived HSTS setting can lock browsers into HTTPS after a mistake.

## Other proxy topologies

A containerised proxy cannot reach the host's loopback port using its own `127.0.0.1`. Put the proxy and application on a deliberately configured shared Docker network and use the application's service address/port 8000, or arrange another restricted host route. A proxy on another machine similarly needs a reachable private address and firewall restriction.

The trusted proxy count must reflect the actual trusted chain. Do not copy `1` when another CDN/proxy sits in front without analysing its header behaviour.

Always forward private file requests through MakerVault. Do not expose `/app/media` as an unauthenticated Nginx alias or static file share. A proxy does not turn MakerVault into a public anonymous download service.


## Optional native HTTPS listener

MakerVault can also serve HTTPS directly on a separate port without adding another container. This is optional; a reverse proxy remains the recommended setup for a stable domain name, public certificate automation and normal ports 80/443.

For direct HTTPS on a trusted LAN, add for example:

```dotenv
MAKERVAULT_HTTPS_ENABLED=true
MAKERVAULT_HTTPS_BIND_ADDRESS=0.0.0.0
MAKERVAULT_HTTPS_PORT=8443
DJANGO_ALLOWED_HOSTS=localhost,127.0.0.1,192.168.1.50
DJANGO_CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS=http://192.168.1.50:8765,https://192.168.1.50:8443
```

The normal HTTP listener remains available on `MAKERVAULT_PORT`, so a reverse proxy can still use it as its backend. Do not enable `DJANGO_SECURE_SSL_REDIRECT` merely because the separate native HTTPS port is enabled: Django's generic redirect does not know that HTTPS is on a different external port, and the HTTP listener may intentionally be serving a trusted reverse proxy.

### Use your own certificate

Put a PEM certificate and matching private key under `KEY_STORAGE/tls` as `cert.pem` and `key.pem`, or change the two in-container paths deliberately:

```dotenv
KEY_STORAGE=/mnt/Server/MakerVault/keys
MAKERVAULT_TLS_CERT_FILE=/app/keys/tls/cert.pem
MAKERVAULT_TLS_KEY_FILE=/app/keys/tls/key.pem
MAKERVAULT_HTTPS_SELF_SIGNED=false
```

The pair may be CA-issued or self-signed. MakerVault validates that both files are readable and match before starting the HTTPS listener.

### Generate a persistent self-signed certificate

For a local/test deployment, MakerVault can generate a certificate once and keep it under `KEY_STORAGE/tls`:

```dotenv
MAKERVAULT_HTTPS_ENABLED=true
MAKERVAULT_HTTPS_BIND_ADDRESS=0.0.0.0
MAKERVAULT_HTTPS_PORT=8443
MAKERVAULT_HTTPS_SELF_SIGNED=true
MAKERVAULT_HTTPS_SELF_SIGNED_NAMES=192.168.1.50,makervault.local
DJANGO_CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS=https://192.168.1.50:8443
```

Open `https://192.168.1.50:8443` (substituting your address). A self-signed certificate is encrypted TLS, but browsers do not trust it automatically. Import/trust the certificate or its issuing CA on each client if you want to remove the browser warning. MakerVault deliberately does not disable browser certificate verification.

The generated certificate/key are persistent and are included in new managed `.mvbackup` bundles. Existing v2 recovery bundles remain supported; because they predate native TLS, restoring one does not erase key storage already present on the target.

If every browser-facing route is HTTPS, set `DJANGO_SECURE_COOKIES=true`. If you still intentionally use direct HTTP for interactive browser access, secure-only session cookies will prevent sign-in over that HTTP route.
