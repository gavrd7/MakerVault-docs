# Maintaining and publishing the user guide

The user guide documents the current release. It uses Markdown under `docs/guide`, Material for MkDocs and a separate `mkdocs.yml`. Existing engineering notes under `docs/` are not included in the public build. No application settings, volumes or runtime services are changed.

## Local preview and validation

From the repository root, use Python 3.12 or newer in a dedicated virtual environment:

```bash
python3 -m venv /tmp/makervault-docs-venv
. /tmp/makervault-docs-venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install -r docs/requirements.txt
python -m mkdocs build --strict
python scripts/check_guide_links.py
python -m mkdocs serve
```

Open the local address printed by MkDocs (normally `http://127.0.0.1:8000`). Dependencies are independent of the application requirements. Top-level theme/build versions are pinned; review dependency updates deliberately. Do not commit `site/` or the virtual environment.

## Publishing with GitHub Pages

GitHub Pages is appropriate for a static manual; it does not run MakerVault itself. The repository is private at the time this guide was prepared. Pages from private repositories requires an eligible GitHub plan. Pages sites are ordinarily public even when the source repository is private; check your intended visibility before publishing.

The included `guide.yml` workflow builds documentation for documentation PRs/main changes and uploads a preview artifact. Deployment happens only when explicitly run with `publish=true` from `main`. It does not automatically publish on merge.

1. Review and merge the documentation PR.
2. In repository **Settings → Pages**, choose **GitHub Actions** as the build source (if the account/repository supports it).
3. Review the `github-pages` environment's deployment protection rules and intended public content.
4. Open **Actions → MakerVault user guide → Run workflow**, choose `main`, and enable **Publish to GitHub Pages**.
5. Open the URL reported by the deploy job. For this repository the expected project-site URL is `https://gavrd7.github.io/MakerVault-docs/` unless Pages/custom-domain settings change it.
6. Test navigation, search, code copying and a narrow/mobile viewport on the published site.

If Pages is unavailable for the private repository, a separate public documentation repository is an alternative. Copy only the documentation source/build assets, update `repo_url`, `edit_uri` and `site_url`, and review before making that repository public. Do not change the application repository's visibility just to host the guide.

## Edit a chapter

1. Use a short-lived documentation branch.
2. Update the Markdown chapter alongside a feature change. Preserve stable filenames/anchors where possible.
3. Add a navigation entry in `mkdocs.yml` for a new chapter.
4. Run the strict build and link checker.
5. Preview the page, check mobile layout and update the source/version note when revalidating an edition.
6. Open a PR. Publish the reviewed edition through the manual workflow.

For a task page, use: goal; prerequisites/permissions; numbered procedure; expected result; common failures; relevant next link. Keep beginner paths concrete. Place optional infrastructure complexity in Advanced features. Do not describe planned adapters as available.

## Source map for reviewers

| Guide subject | Implementation to check |
| --- | --- |
| Install, storage, backup paths | `compose.yaml`, `.env.example`, `docker/entrypoint.sh` |
| Authentication/OIDC/email | `backend/makervault/settings.py`, account/provider forms/templates |
| Roles | `backend/core/management/commands/seed_roles.py` |
| Quotas/private ownership | `backend/core/storage_usage.py`, `user_admin.py`, API ownership checks |
| Catalogue/inventory/projects/files | Corresponding frontend page and backend API handlers |
| Printing and integrations | `PrintingPage.jsx`, `SettingsPage.jsx`, provider sync modules |
| Model intelligence | Model-analysis code and `ModelViewer.jsx` |

## Before v1 publication

- Revalidate every chapter against the release commit; update the edition notice and footer.
- Run a clean beginner install, a second-user permission check and a complete restore on a separate host.
- Check backup commands using both named volumes and bind mounts, including custom key-source handling.
- Confirm supported hardware/platforms; document tested baselines rather than inventing minimum specifications.
- Test enabled integration directions with representative services/hardware and record limitations.
- Verify proxy/OIDC instructions with the chosen supported example providers.
- Add sanitised screenshots for initial setup, inventory, BOM allocation, versions, printing and account storage. Use consistent viewport/data, descriptive alt text and no credentials.
- Decide whether to archive pre-v1 docs or introduce versioned documentation; avoid multiple divergent copies before needed.
- Verify published Pages URLs, search and accessibility. Never publish `.env`, backups or real users' private screenshots.

The initial edition is source-reviewed and build-validated; live deployment and hardware integration acceptance remain separate checks. Record completed acceptance evidence in release notes rather than implying the documentation build exercised the application.
